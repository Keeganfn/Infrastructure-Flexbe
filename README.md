You will need to also download FlexBe use the installation instructions here:
http://philserver.bplaced.net/fbe/download.php


I recommend building from source as I have had bad luck with the binary.


The other packages you will need to use the arm with flexbe are in another package that I am currently working on
right now you will either have to integrate your own action servers or just use it with infrastructure hardware.
